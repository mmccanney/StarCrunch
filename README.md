Around 1982-ish I slick-talked my way into the fledgling computer lab in our middle school. The lab teacher told me I could use the lab on my lunch break. I could use it to learn programming... not for playing games. However, _creating_ games was ok.

This was my first "video" game. It was far from what most would think of as a video game but it was fun, and became popular amongst my nerd friends.



Here I've recreated that old text based game into a real video game.
