# StarCrunch

Around 1982-ish I slick-talked my way into the fledgling computer lab in our middle school. The lab teacher told me I could use the lab on my lunch break. I could use it to learn programming... not for playing games. However, _creating_ games was ok.

This was my first "video" game. <br>

It was far from what most would think of as a video game but it was fun, and became popular amongst my nerd friends.

The c64 is the original code, from when I was 11.

Years ago, I used VB to re-create it.

Then, many more years later I reproduced the the game under linux in the _nix folder.

The newest is under the sfml folder. I created it based off a tutorial from Vittorio Romeo. It's kind of just thrown together and is not what I would consider a good design. Maybe later I'll clean it up.

Of note re: the SFML version. I was trying to use this as a way to get my eldest daughter interested in programming. She and I created the sound effect of the firing laser by stretching her slinky across some beams and twipping it while recording the sound. She thought it was hilarious. And, it actually created a decent sound for the game.
