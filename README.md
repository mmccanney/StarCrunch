Around 1982-ish I slick-talked my way into the fledgling computer lab in our middle school. The lab teacher told me I could use the lab on my lunch break. I could use it to learn programming... not for playing games. However, _creating_ games was ok.

This was my first "video" game. It was far from what most would think of as a video game but it was fun, and became popular amongst my nerd friends.

The c64 is the original code, from when I was 11.

I reproduced the flavor of the game under unix in the _nix folder.

The newest is under the sfml folder. I created it based off a templet from ____. It's kind of just thrown together and is not what I would consider a good design. Maybe later I'll clean it up.
